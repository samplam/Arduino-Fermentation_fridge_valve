# Arduino-Fermentation_fridge_valve
Program to control the position of a homemade linear valve for a modified 3 cu ft fridge. It's coded for a Nano board.

## Overview
This project is an Arduino-based that I made to control the position of a homemade linear valve for a modified 3 cu ft fridge. The intended final use was to have a small cabinet that holds the internal temperature at around 20 deg C during summer for food fermenting while keeping the original compressor part and avoid condensation. Unfortunately, tests shown that it was not possible.

## Features
- Basic automation functions, loops and logic  
- Commented and structured code for readability

## Skills Highlighted
- Programming in C/C++ for microcontrollers
- Basic electronics and automation principles

## Usage
1. Open `Fermentation_fridge_valve_v2025-09.ino` in Arduino IDE  
2. Upload to the Arduino board
3. Connect the input and output as per requirements
4. Test the program

## Notes
- Due to time constrains and first time stepper motor contact for me, this program was coded with the help of ChatGPT. It was somewhat working, but the physical limitations of the project forced me to abandon it.
